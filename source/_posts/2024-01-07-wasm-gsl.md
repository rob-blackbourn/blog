I was recently contacted by someone trying to follow a
[previous blog](https://rob-blackbourn.github.io/blog/2020/06/24/wasm-gsl/)
on cross compiling C to WebAssembly. Things weren't working; it seemed that things had changed.

This is a short post to look at how to cross compile an open source library to WebAssembly
using the current tooling (as of 2024-01-07).

As before I'll use the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl),
which (at the time of writing) is version 2.7.1.

## The toolchain

As before I used the clang toolchain from [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk).
I downloaded [wasi-sdk-21.0-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-21/wasi-sdk-21.0-linux.tar.gz)
and unpacked it to `$HOME/local/wasi-sdk-21.0`.

I put the following shell script in the root folder of the GSL.

```bash
WASI_SDK_HOME=$HOME/local/wasi-sdk-21.0

export PATH=$WASI_SDK_HOME/bin:$PATH

# Copy the wasm aware config files.
cp $WASI_SDK_HOME/share/misc/config.* .

rm -rf ./build
mkdir build
cd build

CC=clang \
CFLAGS="-fno-trapping-math --sysroot=$WASI_SDK_HOME/share/wasi-sysroot -mthread-model single" \
CPP=clang-cpp \
AR=llvm-ar \
RANLIB=llvm-ranlib \
NM=llvm-nm \
LD=wasm-ld \
../configure \
    --prefix=$HOME/local/gsl-2.7 \
    --host=wasm32-wasi \
    --enable-shared=no

# build and install it.
make
make install
```

There are three key changes from the previous method.

First the `autoconf` config files in the root folder GSL are overwritten by
those in the `was-sdk` with `cp $WASI_SDK_HOME/share/misc/config.* .`.
This provides the information autoconf needs to configure the project for
WebAssembly.

Second the flags to the compiler are now `--sysroot=$WASI_SDK_HOME/share/wasi-sysroot`,
rather than the previous `--target=wasm32-wasi`.

Lastly `make` should be called before `make install` for the project to build correctly.

## Testing

I used the same example program as before.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>

int main (int argc, char** argv)
{
  double x = 5.0;
  double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (x);
  printf ("J0(%g) = %.18e\n", x, y);
  return 0;
}
```

The following script was used to compile it.

```bash
set -x

WASI_SDK_HOME=$HOME/local/wasi-sdk-21.0
GSL_HOME=$HOME/local/gsl-2.7

export PATH=$WASI_SDK_HOME/bin:$PATH

clang \
    example.c -o example \
    -O2 --sysroot=$WASI_SDK_HOME/share/wasi-sysroot \
    -I$GSL_HOME/include -L$GSL_HOME/lib -lgsl -lm -lc
```

The executable was indeed WebAssembly.

```bash
$ file example
example: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP)
```

As before we can test it with [wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer), 
using [wasmer-linux-amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer/releases/download/v4.2.5/wasmer-linux-amd64.tar.gz).
version 4.2.5, and unpacked it to `$HOME/local/wasmer-4.2.5`.

```bash
$ $HOME/local/wasmer-4.2.5/bin/wasmer example 
J0(5) = -1.775967713143382642e-01
```

Success!

## Thoughts

It was worth the effort re-visiting this. I think my original
post was incomplete (I suspect I had copied the config files
in the previous attempt and forgotten), but also there were
some real changes.
